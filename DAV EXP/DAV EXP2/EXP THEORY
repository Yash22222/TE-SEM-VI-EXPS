AIM - Simple Linear Regression in Python.

THEORY - Simple Linear Regression, a statistical method implemented in Python, serves as a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the relationship between two variables: 
a dependent variable (response) and an independent variable (predictor). The primary objective of this experiment is to apply Simple Linear Regression to a dataset, 
enabling the prediction of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable.

1] Linear Regression Equation:- The fundamental equation Y=b0​+b1​⋅X+ε expresses the linear relationship, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, 
b0 is the intercept, b1 is the slope, and ε represents the error term.

2] Least Squares Method:- The method of Least Squares is employed to determine the optimal values of b0 and b1, minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.

3] Scikit-Learn Library:- Implementation of Simple Linear Regression is facilitated by the Scikit-Learn library in Python. Leveraging the LinearRegression class streamlines processes 
such as model training, prediction, and evaluation.

# Experiment Steps:-

1] Data Preparation:- Collect and preprocess the dataset, ensuring it contains values for both the dependent and independent variables.
2] Data Splitting:- Segregate the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
3] Model Training:- Utilize the training data to train the Simple Linear Regression model, estimating the optimal parameters b0 and b1
​4] Model Prediction:- Apply the trained model to the testing set, generating predictions for the dependent variable based on independent variable values.
5] Model Evaluation:- Assess the accuracy of the model's predictions by comparing them to actual values, employing metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.

Conclusion:- Through the practical implementation of Simple Linear Regression in Python, this experiment aims to showcase its effectiveness in predicting and understanding the relationship between two variables. 
By following these steps, the experiment provides insights into the model's performance and its applicability in real-world scenarios for making data-driven predictions.
