AIM - TIME SERIES ANALYSIS IN PYTHON / R

THEORY - Time series analysis is a powerful tool for extracting meaningful insights from temporal data. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, provides an efficient and accessible platform for conducting time series analysis. 
By understanding patterns, trends, and seasonality, organizations can make informed decisions and predictions for the future based on historical data. Continuous refinement of models ensures accurate forecasting, 
making time series analysis a valuable asset in various domains.
The effectiveness of time series analysis heavily depends on the quality and nature of the data, the appropriateness of the chosen model, and the consistency of patterns over time. 
Regular monitoring and adjustment of models contribute to the reliability of predictions.

Python Tools:-
1] Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
2] Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization.
3] Statsmodels: Implementing time series models.
4] Scikit-learn: Model evaluation and forecasting.

TSA STEPS:-
1. Introduction, 2. Data Preparation, 3. Visualization, 4. Decomposition, 5. Stationarity, 6. Modeling, 7. Model Evaluation, 8. Forecasting, 9. Conclusion

Conclusion - Time series analysis helps in extracting insights from historical data. It Enables better decision-making based on future predictions & Regularly update and retrain models for accurate forecasting.
