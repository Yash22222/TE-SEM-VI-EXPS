AIM - Design and Implementation of a product cipher using Substitution & Transposition Ciphers.

Theory - 1] Substitution Cipher:- Replaces each letter in the plaintext with a different letter based on a fixed rule.
Shifting Mechanism: Shifts each letter by a certain number of positions in the alphabet, known as the key.
Key: Determines the amount of shift. In this case, the key is 15.

2] Encryption Process:-
For each letter in the plaintext: 2. Check if it's an alphabet. 3. If it's an uppercase letter, use 'A' as the base for shifting. 4. If it's a lowercase letter, use 'a' as the base. 5. Shift the character's ASCII code by the key, wrapping around the alphabet using the modulo operator (% 26). 6. Convert the shifted code back to a character and append it to the ciphertext. 7. If it's not an alphabet, keep it as it is in the ciphertext.
Ciphertext: The encrypted message, consisting of the shifted letters.

3] Example:-
Plaintext: ENEMY ATTACK TODAY
Key: 15
Ciphertext: YVTBA QLLFZV YBLOL

4] Decryption:- To decrypt, shift each letter in the ciphertext back by the same key positions in the opposite direction.

# Additive and Multiplicative Ciphers:
1] Additive Cipher (e.g., Caesar Cipher):-

1] Encryption: Shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions (key) in the alphabet.
2] Formula: C = (P + K) % 26 (where C is ciphertext, P is plaintext, K is key)
3] Key Space: 26 possible keys (0-25 shifts)
4] Example: With a key of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.

2] Multiplicative Cipher:-

1] Encryption: Multiplies each letter's position in the alphabet by a fixed number (key), then takes the remainder when divided by 26.
2] Formula: C = (P * K) % 26
3] Key Space: Potentially larger key space, but limited by coprimality with 26 (keys must be relatively prime to 26). Valid keys include 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.
4] Example: With a key of 5, 'A' becomes 'F' (1 * 5 = 5, 5 % 26 = 5, which corresponds to 'F'), 'B' becomes 'K', and so on.

# Key Differences:-

1] Operation:- Additive ciphers add a value, while multiplicative ciphers multiply.
2] Key Space:- Multiplicative ciphers have a potentially larger key space, but not all keys are valid due to coprimality requirements.
3] Security:- Both are simple substitution ciphers and can be broken relatively easily with frequency analysis or brute force attacks.

11] Transposition Cipher:-
1] A transposition cipher is a method of encryption where the positions of the characters in the plaintext are shifted according to a certain system, 
creating the ciphertext. In simpler terms, it involves rearranging the order of characters to obfuscate the original message.

12] Keyless Transposition Cipher:-
1] In a keyless transposition cipher, the arrangement of characters is done without using a predefined key. The message is typically arranged in a grid, 
and the ciphertext is generated by reading the characters in a different order from the grid. The grid can have a fixed number of rows and columns, 
and the message is filled into the grid row-wise and read column-wise or vice versa.

# Encryption (Example):
Original Message: "ENEMY ATTACK TODAY" = the encrypted message would be: "EYDNATMEOYKTCAAK"

13] Key-based Transposition Cipher:-
In a key-based transposition cipher, a specific key is used to determine the arrangement of characters during encryption and their rearrangement during decryption. 
The key specifies the order in which columns are read during encryption and rearranged during decryption. 
This adds an extra layer of security, as the key is needed to decipher the message correctly.

CONCLUSION - Transposition ciphers provide a way to obscure the original message by changing the order of characters. 
While keyless transposition is simpler, key-based transposition adds an extra layer of security.
