Q1 - Comparative study of different hosted and bare metal Hypervisors with suitable parameters along with their use in public/private cloud platform

ANS - 

Parameters             	Hosted Hypervisor	                           Bare-Metal Hypervisor

Installation	          Runs on top of a host operating system	     Installed directly on server hardware

Resource Access	        VMs share resources managed by the host OS	 VMs directly access hardware resources

Performance	            Lower due to resource sharing with host OS	 Higher due to direct hardware access

Scalability	            Limited by underlying host resources	       Scales efficiently with additional hardware

Management Complexity	  Easier to set up and manage	                 Requires specialized skills and tools

Cost	                  Typically lower initial cost	               Higher initial cost

Security	              Host OS vulnerabilities can affect VMs	     More secure isolation between VMs

Examples	              VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Docker	     VMware ESXi, KVM, Microsoft Hyper-V

Use in Public Cloud	    Primarily for development and testing	       Often used for production workloads requiring high performance and isolation

Use in Private Cloud	  Suitable for small-scale deployments or      Popular choice for larger private clouds and mission-critical workloads
                        specific use cases

Examples of use in Cloud Platforms:-

1] Public Cloud (Hosted): Many public cloud providers leverage hosted hypervisors like KVM or Xen for their virtual machines due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness.
2] Private Cloud (Bare-Metal): Organizations building private clouds often opt for bare-metal hypervisors like VMware ESXi or Microsoft Hyper-V for higher performance, security, and control over their infrastructure.
